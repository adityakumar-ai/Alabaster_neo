# Implementation of Temporal Memory Parallel Version
## Group name- Alabaster_neo


This group project aims to implement the parallel version of Temporal Memory. As this algorithm is currenty implemented as single threaded process, the task is to re-implement specific algorithmic components in order to benefit from multithreading and Enhance performance and efficiency.

To Implement this, in short:

* We first understand the basic concept of Temporal Memory Algoritm and its working.
* Replacing the oringal SYNC code, FOR loops and making use of async methods and parallel loops
* Creating addional unit tests and making sure the existing unit test are succesful with the parallel TM Implementation
* Comparing Performances/Creating graphs
